  description = "Previous work has shown that left posterior middle temporal gyrus regions are important for the controlled retrieval of aspects of semantic representations that are relevant to the current context/goals, and that these regions seem to form a left-lateralised network with other regions in inferior frontal gyrus. This project aims to characterise if differences in the architecture of white matter tracts and their projections across the left and right cerebral hemispheres contribute to the organisation of a left-lateralised network involved in semantic control, as has been observed using intrinsic connectivity"

  description = "Studying potential mechanisms for the left-lateralisation observed in the semantic control component during my PhD; a promising direction for this could be to think about the interaction of different large-scale cortical networks in left vs right hemisphere: preliminary evidence suggests that integration vs segregation of DMN-MDN across the hemispheres could be useful in elucidating attentional and linguistic lateralised phenomena previously described in the literature; my future research aims to capitalise in recent developments, such as the description of a hierarchy of cortical gradients, or ever-more-sophisticated atlasing work; together with large-scale automated meta-analysis techniques for determining/confirming ROIs, this could help us describe differences in network interactions across the hemispheres and how they potentially give rise to lateralised, important areas"
