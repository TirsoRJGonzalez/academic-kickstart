I am a Research Associate at in the [Department of Psychology](https://www.york.ac.uk/psychology) of the University of York and [York Neuroimaging Centre](https://www.york.ac.uk/psychology/research/york-neuroimaging-centre/) working with Professor [Beth Jefferies](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=9OBIArkAAAAJ&hl=en). I received my PhD in Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging from the University of York (2020), and my MSc in Clinical Neuropsychology from the [National Autonomous University of Mexico](https://www.unam.mx/). I am interested in understanding how large-scale cortical networks and intrinsic connectivity gradients organise to give rise to semantic cognition and language through the interaction of control and default mode networks. My main research tools have included fMRI (both task-based and resting-state), gradient decomposition, multivariate analyses, DTI tractography, TMS, cognitive paradigms, automated meta-analytical techniques and cognitive decoding.

As a general approach to research, I am keen on promoting open science, replicability and data-sharing best practices with my future work, pushing for greater transparency, integration and replicability of results across labs in the world. I would like to do further work with fMRI and TMS, as well as expanding to MEG to probe the temporal resolution and causal dynamics of semantic processing. I would be especially interested in joining a research environment in which I can expand my methodological and analysis toolbox and solve more complex questions through collaborative research.

I have worked as a neuroscience research fellow, lecturer and clinical neuropsychologist in three countries over the last 10 years. Born in [Merida (Yucatan, Mexico)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A9rida,_Yucat%C3%A1n), I received my undegraduate degree in Psychology by [Universidad Anahuac](https://www.anahuac.mx/), and went on to do an integrated MSc, combining two clinical internships in hospitals with Masters studies in Neuropsychology at [Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico](https://www.unam.mx/). After developing an interest in language neuroscience, I was awarded an international rotation grant as a result of outstanding clinical work during my internships to [Centro Internacional de Restauracion Neurologica](http://www.ciren.cu/) in Havana, Cuba. 

Having returned to Mexico after the international rotation and receiving my MSc degree, I was offered a research fellowship at my Alma Mater, the school of Psychology of Universidad Anahuac Mayab. There, I started the Cognitive and Clinical Neuropsychology Research Group, where my research focussed on hemispheric differences in language processing, measured mainly through behavioural methods such as [dichotic listening](http://dichoticlistening.com/dichotic-listening.html), [semantic priming](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/semantic-priming) and [divided visual fields](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16754238). During this post I accepted a lectureship in the school of Psychology, where I mainly thaught psychology of language, research methods, experimental psychology, neuropsychology, neuroanatomy and statistics.

After three projects in the research fellowship, my interests shifted to the neural bases of semantics; this led me to pursue a PhD on the subject, which I recently graduated. Under the supervision of Professors [Beth Jefferies](https://www.york.ac.uk/psychology/staff/academicstaff/ej514/) and [Jonny Smallwood](https://www.queensu.ca/psychology/jonathan-smallwood) in the [Department of Psychology of University of York](https://www.york.ac.uk/psychology/) and [York Neuroimaging Centre](https://www.ynic.york.ac.uk/), I worked on hemispheric differences in semantic cognition using fMRI as my main neuroimaging tool. My PhD thesis investigated differences in intrinsic connectivity of key regions of the semantic cognition network across the hemispheres and their behavioural consequences, using a combination of resting-state and task-based fMRI, large-scale cortical network interactions, individual differences approaches, automated meta-analytical techniques and cognitive decoding. The results of the PhD work, both for my thesis and in collaborations with the broader research group can be consulted in my recent [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wX11AbntPtUC&hl=en)

On my free time, I like to learn programming languages andimprove on scripting through personal projects and work in visual arts projects as a hobby: ([VJing](https://liveperformersmeeting.net/editions/2018-rome/artists/ccs/), glitch and algorithmic art, [film criticism [in Spanish]](https://en.yelp.be/biz/la-esquina-del-goya-m%C3%A9rida)), reading, listening to podcasts and playing videogames (you can find me on Blizzard [tarantirso#1468], Steam [441497605], Xbox [tarantirso] or MTG Arena [tarantirso#98874]).
