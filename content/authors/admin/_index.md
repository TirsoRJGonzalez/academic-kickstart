I am a cognitive neuroscientist who works with and is deeply interested in language and semantics. I got my PhD in Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging from the University of York (January 2020), and my MSc from the National Autonomous University of Mexico in Clinical Neuropsychology. I have worked as a research fellow, associate lecturer and clinical neuropsychologist in three countries over the last 10 years. I am interested in understanding the neural bases of hemispheric differences in language and semantics. My research is mainly focussed on fMRI (both task-based and resting-state), using cognitive paradigms and large-scale cognitive decoding. [ADD MORE]

Born in [Merida (Yucatan, Mexico)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A9rida,_Yucat%C3%A1n), I received my undegraduate degree in Psychology by [Universidad Anahuac](https://www.anahuac.mx/), and went on to do an integrated MSc, combining a medical internship with masters studies in Neuropsychology at [Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico](https://www.unam.mx/). After developing an interest in language neuroscience, I was awarded an international rotation grant as a result of outstanding clinical work during my internship to [Centro Internacional de Restauracion Neurologica](http://www.ciren.cu/). 

Having returned to Mexico after my international rotation and receiving my MSc degree, I got offered a research fellowship at my Alma Mater, the school of Psychology of Universidad Anahuac Mayab. There, I started the Cognitive and Clinical Neuropsychology Research Group, where my research focussed on hemispheric differences in language processing, measured mainly through behavioural methods such as [dichotic listening](http://dichoticlistening.com/dichotic-listening.html), [semantic priming](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/semantic-priming) and [divided visual fields](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16754238). During this post I accepted a lectureship in the school of Psychology, where I mainly thaught psychology of language, research methods, experimental psychology, neuropsychology and statistics.

After my last project in the research fellowship, my interests shifted specifically to the neural bases of semantics, which led me to pursue a PhD on the subject, which I recently graduated (Viva date: January 27, 2020). Under the supervision of Professors [Beth Jefferies](https://www.york.ac.uk/psychology/staff/academicstaff/ej514/) and [Jonny Smallwood](https://www.york.ac.uk/psychology/staff/academicstaff/jonathan_smallwood/) in the Departemnt of Psychology of University of York, and York Neuroimaging Centre, I worked on hemispheric differences in semantic cognition using fMRI as my main neuroimaging tool. My PhD thesis investigated differences in intrinsic connectivity of key regions of the semantic cognition network, and their behavioural consequences, using a combination of resting-state and task-based fMRI, large-scale cortical network interactions, individual differences approaches, automated meta-analytical techniques and cognitive decoding. The PhD work, both for my thesis and in collaborations with the broader research group resulted can be consulted in my recent [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wX11AbntPtUC&hl=en)
