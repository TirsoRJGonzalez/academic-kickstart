abstract: "Contemporary neuroscientific accounts suggest that ventral anterior temporal lobe (ATL) regions act as a bilateral heteromodal semantic hub. However, research also shows graded functional differences between the hemispheres relating to linguistic versus non-linguistic semantic tasks and to knowledge of objects versus people. Individual differences in connectivity from bilateral ATL and between left and right ATL might therefore give rise to differences in function within this system. We investigated whether the relative strength of intrinsic connectivity from left and right ATL would relate to differences in performance on semantic tasks. We examined resting-state fMRI in 74 individuals and, in a separate session, examined semantic categorisation, manipulating stimulus type (famous faces versus landmarks) and modality of presentation (visual versus verbal). We found that people with greater connectivity between left and right ATL were more efficient at categorising landmarks, especially when these were presented visually. In addition, participants who showed stronger connectivity from right than left ATL to medial occipital cortex showed more efficient semantic categorisation of landmarks regardless of modality of presentation. These findings show that individual differences in the intrinsic connectivity of left and right ATL are associated with effects of category and modality in semantic categorisation. The results can be interpreted in terms of graded differences in the strengths of inputs from ‘spoke’ regions, such as regions of visual cortex, to a bilateral yet partially segregated semantic ‘hub’, encompassing left and right ATL."
