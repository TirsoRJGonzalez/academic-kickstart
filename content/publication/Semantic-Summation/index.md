abstract: "The capacity to identify aspects of meaning that overlap across multiple concepts mayrelate to individual differences in the strength of intrinsic connectivity within and betweendistinct brain networks supporting semantic cognition. This study examined a semanticsummation task, which tested the capacity to detect weak overlapping aspects of meaning,in 76 participants who were also scanned with resting-state fMRI. We examined associa-tions between summation and the intrinsic connectivity of semantically-relevant defaultmode and control network regions. These networks are implicated in information inte-gration and controlled retrieval respectively. We found higher intrinsic connectivity be-tween default and control networks was associated with better performance in thesummation task. The same pattern of coupling between semantic default mode and con-trol networks was not associated with more efficient retrieval of individual weak asopposed to strong associations in an additional cohort of around 200 participants, sug-gesting this pattern is specific to the summation of multiple concepts, rather than se-mantic task difficulty. Finally, higher connectivity within the default mode network wasassociated with better performance when selecting a word that was strongly-related to asingle probe item, supporting the role of this network in more automatic aspects of se-mantic retrieval."
